      "By engaging with users throughout the product lifecycle, we design and build solutions that enhance their overall experience (PWS 3.1) .",
      "For example, using feedback from the user group, we identified an improved method of tracking CAP milestones (PWS 3.7) .",
      "The milestones are subtasks of the CAP, and each entity is required to notify us when completed.",
      "We found that the proposed enhancement would reap the following benefits for the program: allows additional details to be tracked and monitored, consolidates detailed milestone information into a single section of the case record, and provides the ability to capture an unlimited number of CAP m ilestone dates provided by the audited entity.",
      "The system\u2019s current state allowed only three milestone dates to be entered when most CAPs had more.",
      "Also, important information such as the violation number associated with the milestone, the description of t he milestone, and the completion of the milestone were unable to be tracked.",
      "We presented this method to CMS who approved the change which our team then implemented.",
      "Maintain Operations of a Salesforce Environment: RELI successfully maintains and administers ASETT on Salesforce and supports operations that include HIPAA enforcement for tr ansactions, code sets, unique identifiers, and operating rules (PWS 3.11) .",
      "We perform software releases and provide operational support, meet functional and system requirements, and ensure configuration management.",

      "Our assessments also lead to the future development or revision of standards and operating rules that may then be recommend ed to the Standard Development Organizations and Operating Rule Authoring Entity.",
      "We determine whether the selected covered entity is compliant with electronic standards by reviewing and validating electronic transactions using third party validation softwar e, reviewing operating rule processes and data, capturing operating rule attest ations, entering results into a tracking system, creating a summary of the assessment outcomes, sending assessment notices to the covered entity, and facilitating a corrective action process when warranted.",
      "Through this process of conducting compliance rev iews (PWS 3.8) , RELI identified covered entities that are non -compliant with HIPAA and ACA requirements, determined that corrective action was warranted, and subsequently provided the entity with a template to create a plan to achieve compliance.",

      "Should a covered entity not follow through and abide by the CAP and correct their deficiencies, or not cooperate with the assessment and investigation process (PWS 3.6) , they are subject to civil money penalties (CMPs).",
      "CMS has not assessed any CMPs against covered entit ies for violations of HIPAA Administrative Simplification rules but is authorized by the statute to do so and is in the process of creating guidelines to begin imposing these penalties.",
      "RELI maintains an initial draft of an SOP document for Administrative Simplification Enforcement and Testing Tool (ASETT) CMPs and has worked with CMS to institute a framework to support the CMP process.",
      "The draft document elaborates on the investigation process, liability, determination of the penalty amount, the grounds for waiver, hearing, and the appeal proces s. 14.",
      "Analyzing HIPAA complaints that may be filed by external entities; and evaluating transaction testing results: RELI\u2019s experience analyzing HIPAA complaints filed by external entities includes our work on the CMS ASETT contract since 2019 (PWS 3.2).",
      "When new complaints are submitted in ASETT, our team analyzes each one and makes recommendations to CMS for the next steps (PWS 3.4).",
      "One of the first steps in analyzing HIPAA complaints is the preliminary evaluation.",
      "During this process, we complete an initial review and check for missing or incomplete information such as demographics, transaction files, and other supporting informatio n (PWS 3.3) .",
      "We determine whether it is valid for ASETT or invalid and should be referred to another organization.",
      "HIPAA Privacy and Security complaints are out of scope for ASETT and subsequently referred to the Office for Civil Rights.",
